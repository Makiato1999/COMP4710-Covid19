#### Background:
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in early 2020, students from all over the world have very different attitudes towards studying in Canada. To find out the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the willingness to study in Canada, we use the number of newly effective Canada student permit holders from various countries to analyse the relationship between willingness to study abroad and the development of the COVID-19 epidemic in the corresponding countries.

#### Activities:
We will collect the number of Canadian study permit holders from different countries before and after the COVID19 epidemic, as well as the data on the trend of the COVID19 epidemic in each country and the parameters of affected layers in those countries (e.g. unemployment rate, duration of lockdown, etc). Thus, the relationship between the epidemic and the willingness to study in Canada is derived. 

#### Expectation:
Analysing the relationship between the epidemic and the number of students from different countries who actually decided to study in Canada is helpful for optimising the related industries and government services regarding an impactive enduring global event.
